title: WbXbc Project Started
---

WbXbc is my first soft IP hobby project. It is a collection of standard compontents for builing costomized [Wishbone](https://opencores.org/howto/wishbone) crossbar switches.

My main motivation behind this project is to get some hands-on experience with open source EDA tools. One of my goals is to completely verify this IP using free formal verification tools.
