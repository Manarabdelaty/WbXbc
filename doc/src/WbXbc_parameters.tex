\section{Integration Parameters}
\label{param}

This section specifies the integration parameters to configure the WbXbc components.
Each WbXbc component supports a subset of the parameters listed below.

\begin{description}[style=nextline]

\item[\texttt{ITR\_CNT}]
The number of initiator bus interfaces to be offered by the WbXbc component

\item[\texttt{TGT\_CNT}] 
The number of target bus interfaces to be offered by the WbXbc component

\item[\texttt{ADDR\_WIDTH}] 
Width of all address busses (ADR\_I and ADR\_0)

\item[\texttt{ITR\_ADDR\_WIDTH}] 
Width of the initiator address bus(ses) (ADR\_I), in case it differs
from the target address bus(es) (ADR\_O) 

\item[\texttt{SEL\_WIDTH}] 
Number data select lines of all initiator and target busses
(SEL\_I and SEL\_O)  

\item[\texttt{ITR\_SEL\_WIDTH}] 
Number of data select lines of the initiator bus (SEL\_I), in case it
from the target bus (SEL\_O) 

\item[\texttt{DATA\_WIDTH}] 
Width of all data busses (initiator and target, read and write direction) 

\item[\texttt{ITR\_DATA\_WIDTH}] 
Width of the initiator's data busses (read and write direction

\item[\texttt{TGA\_WIDTH}] 
Number of tags associated with the address busses of the initiator and
the target (TGA\_I and TGA\_O) 

\item[\texttt{TGC\_WIDTH}] 
Number of tags associated with the cycle indicators (CYC\_I and CYC\_O) of
thw initiator and the target (TGC\_I and TGC\_O)

\item[\texttt{TGRD\_WIDTH}] 
Number of tags assoociated with the read data busses of the initiator and
the target (TGD\_O and TGD\_I) 

\item[\texttt{TGWD\_WIDTH}] 
Number of tags associated with the write data busses of the initiator and
the target (TGD\_I and TGD\_O) 

\item[\texttt{BIG\_ENDIAN}] 
Selects the endianess of the design (1=big endian, 0=little endian)

\end{description}
